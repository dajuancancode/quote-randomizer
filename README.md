# Quote Randomizer

![alt text](assets/Screenshot.png "Home Page")

This is a quote randomizer that I built over a period of one day. I wanted to test out some javascript that I was learning through treehouse. The site isn't much to look at, but I found the project to be very fun. I still need to figure out a way to add the twitter functionality.
